i want to host the backend in aws, i have already hosted our PostgreSQL database on aws rds. now let us test it locally.

For local testing against the AWS-hosted PostgreSQL database, the backend environment configuration must be updated so that it no longer points to a local database. The primary variable that must be changed is the database connection variable, typically named DATABASE_URL. This variable should be updated to contain the full AWS RDS PostgreSQL connection string, which includes the AWS RDS endpoint as the host, port 5432, the application database name (for example, mibodb), the master database username (mibo_admin), and the corresponding password. The connection string must also explicitly enable SSL, as AWS RDS requires encrypted connections by default. If the backend uses individual variables instead of a single connection URL, then the following variables must be updated: DB_HOST should be set to the AWS RDS endpoint, DB_PORT should be set to 5432, DB_NAME should be set to the application database name hosted on AWS, DB_USER should be set to the RDS master username, and DB_PASSWORD should be set to the RDS master password. Any variables that previously referenced localhost, 127.0.0.1, or a local PostgreSQL instance must be removed or replaced. No changes are required to application-level environment variables such as server port, JWT secrets, API keys, or third-party service credentials for this test; only the database-related environment variables need to be modified. Once these variables are updated, running the backend locally will cause it to connect directly to the AWS RDS database, allowing verification that credentials, SSL requirements, and schema compatibility are all correct before deployment.


DATABASE_URL=postgresql://mibo_admin:<mibo#aws2026>@mibo-postgres.cj00km2acx6s.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/mibodb?sslmode=require

Ensure your DB client uses DATABASE_URL
